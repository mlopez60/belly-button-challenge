# belly-button-challenge
In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

This challenge was a tough one for me as it took the basic json functions we learned and took it to the next level. 

It took me a bit to figure out how to read the data properly and get the graphs to change correctly. 

1.  Initialize the data/charts
    Set up starting data/charts
2. Set up functions for creating the charts and metadata display
    Pull filtered data and create charts
3. Run the init function
